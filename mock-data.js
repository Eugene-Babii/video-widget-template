          "These headphones are exactly what Ive been looking for, for a long time! I own and have tried pretty much all traditional types wireless headphones i.e. earbuds, over ear and even traditional on ear headphones. However, I cant wear earbuds, traditional on ear or over the ear headphones for any length of time (say 1 hour max) as they just start to hurt my ears, or make them sweat and are generally uncomfortable to me.However these Oladance headphones fit my needs almost perfectly. I use these for listening to music, TV, audiobooks, podcasts, TED talks etc. Ive also used them for cell phone calls, and Teams Conference meetings. With good to great overall results in all of these used cases.Positive attributes:  - Great sound quality  - Im not a audiofile, but seem very good for music to me  - Long battery life (compared to earbuds)  - Very comfortable  - stay on / in place very well  - Work well with all my devices, incl. my TV  - People I have called report good call quality  - App is straight forward and easy to use  - in general no issues connecting or switching devices  - you can hear your environment and carry on a conversation without taking them off. To me this adds to safety and convenience.Negatives / annoyances:  - some issues with them staying connected e.g. (drop outs) and sometimes just one drops. In these cases it sometimes takes more futzing with them than it should to get them reconnected. I am hoping that future firmware updates will address this issue.  This issue is the only thing keeping them from being a full 5 stars. Further this seems to be increasing so it is something I will contact their customer service about.  - I have not tried them on a plane yet, however given the architecture (no noise canceling active or passive), e.g. letting outside noise in, they may not be ideal for that environment / use.- The touch controls do seem to be overly sensitive I have muted / paused them multiple times unintentionally simply by trying to adjust them on my ear or even trying to adjust my glasses. I have also hung up on a caller once accidentally, so yes they do seem overly sensitive.ConclusionOverall I love these headphones they are the best that Ive owned for general overall use.  I bought these in October 2022 and at Christmas I bought two more pairs one for my wife and one for my daughter, that is how much I feel they are a great product.  They have also told me that they love them.  Too early to tell long-term reliability and durability, but they seem to be built well.I rarely write reviews but felt strongly that this product deserved one.",

          "I am crazy happy with this product!  Back story: I love to walk outside but Id like to be aware of my surroundings. I hate earbuds that stick in the ear. So I tried a few bone conducting or open ear.  I have two favorites that I alternate. I have the Shokz, open run.  They definitely deserve an A+ for sound but a B for comfort.  So I gave the Oladance a try.  Score!Pro:  They are so comfortable you will forget you have them on. I do. I went to brush my teeth one night and realized I still had these things hanging over my ears. Absolutely the most comfortable least intrusive devices Ive ever worn. Sounds very good for phone calls very easy to use. There is an app you can download on your phone which will tutor you on how to except phone calls, hang up phone calls, pause and restart your music or podcasts, change volume, etc.  battery life is quite long. I frequently will put these on first thing in the morning and will take them off at the end of the day.  I do find it a whole lot easier to throw this case  in my purse,  or in my pocket - some thing I will not do with the Shokz for fear of damaging them.  Battery life is extremely long. Easily will last all day. I addressed the downside of the case included and separate battery case Con:  Ive seen a couple people complain about the slim a case that comes with the Oladance. The slim white case which you can see in the picture comes with the buds and its not a battery case.  You have to plug it in to charge the buds in the case.  I thought that was kind of silly so I bought the separate charging case. If you look at my second picture its a chunkier case so I wind up not carrying it. It is handy for travel but only because I can put the earbuds in that and use the charging cable on my phone. In 2020 hindsight I wouldnt spend the extra 50 bucks.  Both the battery case and the regular charging case have a USB-C type charging port. Extremely handy.  Sound is not quite as clear as the Shokz.  If youre an audio file and music is your life, I would go with a Shokz instead or something else these are probably not for you. I want to be able to listen to podcasts, make an answer telephone calls.I did try one other set of open earbuds, the little Sony open ears. Unfortunately either its my ears or its a faulty design they did not stay in. I tried all three of the little loop adjusters, I looked at a YouTube tutorial on how to fit them I looked at Sonys tutorial on how to fit them.  No dice.  They probably had the best sound but you would lose them in five minutes. I see no point in spending $150 on something you cant keep in your ears when there are competitors that are almost as good. Sorry Sony, you lose this category.Edit: I purchased another set of open ear over the ear, Arc, by Cleer.  Pro, great sound, best of the 3.  Con, they shut off if not actively using them.  I can wear the Oladance or the shokz all day, and they don't shut off if I'm not actively using them.  So if a phone call comes in and I'm away from my phone, I'm not going to get the incoming call on my headset. I can live with them for music and podcasts, but they may go back.Edit to add:I just purchased a similar set of earpieces, the Cleer Arc.  I thought I would test them out and see whether they were going to be a Christmas gift for one of my kids, keep them myself, or return them like I did the Sony. I decided I'm keeping them. And they all will dance are still my daily wearable.  I like to be able to put on the earpieces and wear them all day without them shutting off even if I'm not on the phone or not listening to music. Unfortunately the Cleer Arc have a shorter battery life and they turn themselves off in 15 minutes if you are actively using them. The great for walks and the clarity of sound is superior to any of the devices I have tried. Decide based on your use.",

        review:
          "Case:I like the storage case they come with. It looks nice and is about the size of a small glasses case. I like the magnetic seats that the headphones sit in, it makes it easy to put them in the case. The case closes magnetically. To charge the headphones, you put them in the storage case and then hook the case up to power with a USB C cable. It comes with a USB C to USB A cable. I usually charge them via my desktop computer, but you could also plug it into a laptop, wall outlet or power bank, etc. There is a separate case you can buy from Oladance that will charge the headphones while they are in the case, but the headphones do not come with that case.Fit:I am very happy with the fit and comfort of the Oladance headphones. I was worried that they might be uncomfortable -- I have pretty sensitive ears that don't play well with most headphones. I really like that they don't go inside the ear canal and don't put any pressure on the inside curvy parts of my ears. Most in-ear wireless earbud type headphones hurt my ears because I have fairly small ears. These are nice because they don't touch the inside of my ears at all. I also have a cartilage piercing and two lobe piercings, and the headphones don't hit the earrings or irritate the piercings at all, which is very nice (I wear studs for reference, not tested with dangly earrings). When I first put the Oladance on I can tell they are there, but I usually forget I have them on because they are so comfortable. I also did not have a problem wearing them with sunglasses, both the headphones and sunglasses fit on my ears fine. I had a little bit of trouble putting my mask on and taking it off with the headphones on, but with more practice I got better. It is a little cumbersome taking a mask off though.Noise canceling:Since they do not go inside the ear canal, they don't offer much noise canceling, which makes sense. It is like holding a tiny speaker close to the opening of your ear. So if you are planning on using them in a very noisy environment, I would reconsider. In the gym, on a treadmill with other noise around, I can still hear fine if I increase the volume. At home with not much background noise, I listen at fairly low volume.Battery life:The battery life is dependent on volume and use case. The lower the volume the better battery life. Customer service said that if listening at 50% volume or less (and not utilizing the microphone), you can get up to 16hrs battery. Listening at 100% volume, you will get around 10 hrs of battery life. If you use them in call mode (with microphone usage) then that lowers battery life as well. I used them for an all day Zoom class (7-8 hrs) where I was talking off and on with the microphone and then the next day for listening to an audiobook and I got a total of 11.5 hrs of battery life before they died. I chatted with customer service about this and they told me that using them in call mode with the microphone uses more battery, so if I had not been using them to speak in Zoom then I likely would've gotten closer to the 16 hr battery life. Customer service said they can get up to 12 hrs battery life being used in call mode.Activities:I enjoy using the Oladance while I am running errands, shopping and driving. I can have both headphones in and still hear if someone talks to me or if I am at the cashier checking out. It also feels safe walking through parking lots and other environments where you want to be aware of your surroundings. The touch controls work fairly well, I can pause with a tap if someone talks to me. The touch controls are fairly sensitive for play and pause, so sometimes I reach up to touch the headphones to make sure they're still there (since they're so comfy sometimes I want to check they are still there lol) and accidentally play or pause my audio. But I'm overall happy with the touch controls. A workout including treadmill, elliptical, cable machine, some weight lifting, etc was fine, no issues with the headphones. Since the headphones just sit on your ears, I don't think they would be great for gymnastics or other activities where you flip upside down forcefully. I haven't personally tried any exercises where I go upside down quickly or with force, so I can't speak to if they stay on or not, but I don't imagine they would. For a slow, gentle standing forward fold hamstring stretch, they did stay on my ears. I shook my head while I was at the bottom of the stretch and they also stayed on.Update: I tried the Oladance headphones while doing a barbell bench press and they did not stay on very well. The right one fell off while I was getting set for the first rep, then the left one worked its way off during my set. I put them back on and the right on stayed on during the next set, but the left one consistently fell off during every set. So they're not super reliable to say on during a bench press, but I guess that's not very surprising.",

          "These headphones are exactly what Ive been looking for, for a long time! I own and have tried pretty much all traditional types wireless headphones i.e. earbuds, over ear and even traditional on ear headphones. However, I cant wear earbuds, traditional on ear or over the ear headphones for any length of time (say 1 hour max) as they just start to hurt my ears, or make them sweat and are generally uncomfortable to me.However these Oladance headphones fit my needs almost perfectly. I use these for listening to music, TV, audiobooks, podcasts, TED talks etc. Ive also used them for cell phone calls, and Teams Conference meetings. With good to great overall results in all of these used cases.Positive attributes:  - Great sound quality  - Im not a audiofile, but seem very good for music to me  - Long battery life (compared to earbuds)  - Very comfortable  - stay on / in place very well  - Work well with all my devices, incl. my TV  - People I have called report good call quality  - App is straight forward and easy to use  - in general no issues connecting or switching devices  - you can hear your environment and carry on a conversation without taking them off. To me this adds to safety and convenience.Negatives / annoyances:  - some issues with them staying connected e.g. (drop outs) and sometimes just one drops. In these cases it sometimes takes more futzing with them than it should to get them reconnected. I am hoping that future firmware updates will address this issue.

          "I am crazy happy with this product!  Back story: I love to walk outside but Id like to be aware of my surroundings. I hate earbuds that stick in the ear. So I tried a few bone conducting or open ear.  I have two favorites that I alternate. I have the Shokz, open run.  They definitely deserve an A+ for sound but a B for comfort.  So I gave the Oladance a try.  Score!Pro:  They are so comfortable you will forget you have them on. I do. I went to brush my teeth one night and realized I still had these things hanging over my ears. Absolutely the most comfortable least intrusive devices Ive ever worn. Sounds very good for phone calls very easy to use. There is an app you can download on your phone which will tutor you on how to except phone calls, hang up phone calls, pause and restart your music or podcasts, change volume, etc.  battery life is quite long. I frequently will put these on first thing in the morning and will take them off at the end of the day.  I do find it a whole lot easier to throw this case  in my purse,  or in my pocket - some thing I will not do with the Shokz for fear of damaging them.  Battery life is extremely long. Easily will last all day. I addressed the downside of the case included and separate battery case Con:  Ive seen a couple people complain about the slim a case that comes with the Oladance. The slim white case which you can see in the picture comes with the buds and its not a battery case.  You have to plug it in to charge the buds in the case.  I thought that was kind of silly so I bought the separate charging case. If you look at my second picture its a chunkier case so I wind up not carrying it. It is handy for travel but only because I can put the earbuds in that and use the charging cable on my phone. In 2020 hindsight I wouldnt spend the extra 50 bucks.  Both the battery case and the regular charging case have a USB-C type charging port. Extremely handy.  Sound is not quite as clear as the Shokz.  If youre an audio file and music is your life, I would go with a Shokz instead or something else these are probably not for you. I want to be able to listen to podcasts, make an answer telephone calls.I did try one other set of open earbuds, the little Sony open ears. Unfortunately either its my ears or its a faulty design they did not stay in. I tried all three of the little loop adjusters, I looked at a YouTube tutorial on how to fit them I looked at Sonys tutorial on how to fit them.  No dice.  They probably had the best sound but you would lose them in five minutes. I see no point in spending $150 on something you cant keep in your ears when there are competitors that are almost as good. Sorry Sony, you lose this category.Edit: I purchased another set of open ear over the ear, Arc, by Cleer.  Pro, great sound, best of the 3.  Con, they shut off if not actively using them.  I can wear the Oladance or the shokz all day, and they don't shut off if I'm not actively using them.  So if a phone call comes in and I'm away from my phone, I'm not going to get the incoming call on my headset. I can live with them for music and podcasts, but they may go back.Edit to add:I just purchased a similar set of earpieces, the Cleer Arc.  I thought I would test them out and see whether they were going to be a Christmas gift for one of my kids, keep them myself, or return them like I did the Sony. I decided I'm keeping them. And they all will dance are still my daily wearable.  I like to be able to put on the earpieces and wear them all day without them shutting off even if I'm not on the phone or not listening to music. Unfortunately the Cleer Arc have a shorter battery life and they turn themselves off in 15 minutes if you are actively using them. The great for walks and the clarity of sound is superior to any of the devices I have tried. Decide based on your use.",

          "Case:I like the storage case they come with. It looks nice and is about the size of a small glasses case. I like the magnetic seats that the headphones sit in, it makes it easy to put them in the case. The case closes magnetically. To charge the headphones, you put them in the storage case and then hook the case up to power with a USB C cable. It comes with a USB C to USB A cable. I usually charge them via my desktop computer, but you could also plug it into a laptop, wall outlet or power bank, etc. There is a separate case you can buy from Oladance that will charge the headphones while they are in the case, but the headphones do not come with that case.Fit:I am very happy with the fit and comfort of the Oladance headphones. I was worried that they might be uncomfortable -- I have pretty sensitive ears that don't play well with most headphones. I really like that they don't go inside the ear canal and don't put any pressure on the inside curvy parts of my ears. Most in-ear wireless earbud type headphones hurt my ears because I have fairly small ears. These are nice because they don't touch the inside of my ears at all. I also have a cartilage piercing and two lobe piercings, and the headphones don't hit the earrings or irritate the piercings at all, which is very nice (I wear studs for reference, not tested with dangly earrings). When I first put the Oladance on I can tell they are there, but I usually forget I have them on because they are so comfortable. I also did not have a problem wearing them with sunglasses, both the headphones and sunglasses fit on my ears fine. I had a little bit of trouble putting my mask on and taking it off with the headphones on, but with more practice I got better. It is a little cumbersome taking a mask off though.Noise canceling:Since they do not go inside the ear canal, they don't offer much noise canceling, which makes sense. It is like holding a tiny speaker close to the opening of your ear. So if you are planning on using them in a very noisy environment, I would reconsider. In the gym, on a treadmill with other noise around, I can still hear fine if I increase the volume. At home with not much background noise, I listen at fairly low volume.Battery life:The battery life is dependent on volume and use case. The lower the volume the better battery life. Customer service said that if listening at 50% volume or less (and not utilizing the microphone), you can get up to 16hrs battery. Listening at 100% volume, you will get around 10 hrs of battery life. If you use them in call mode (with microphone usage) then that lowers battery life as well. I used them for an all day Zoom class (7-8 hrs) where I was talking off and on with the microphone and then the next day for listening to an audiobook and I got a total of 11.5 hrs of battery life before they died. I chatted with customer service about this and they told me that using them in call mode with the microphone uses more battery, so if I had not been using them to speak in Zoom then I likely would've gotten closer to the 16 hr battery life. Customer service said they can get up to 12 hrs battery life being used in call mode.Activities:I enjoy using the Oladance while I am running errands, shopping and driving. I can have both headphones in and still hear if someone talks to me or if I am at the cashier checking out. It also feels safe walking through parking lots and other environments where you want to be aware of your surroundings. The touch controls work fairly well, I can pause with a tap if someone talks to me. The touch controls are fairly sensitive for play and pause, so sometimes I reach up to touch the headphones to make sure they're still there (since they're so comfy sometimes I want to check they are still there lol) and accidentally play or pause my audio. But I'm overall happy with the touch controls. A workout including treadmill, elliptical, cable machine, some weight lifting, etc was fine, no issues with the headphones. Since the headphones just sit on your ears, I don't think they would be great for gymnastics or other activities where you flip upside down forcefully. I haven't personally tried any exercises where I go upside down quickly or with force, so I can't speak to if they stay on or not, but I don't imagine they would. For a slow, gentle standing forward fold hamstring stretch, they did stay on my ears. I shook my head while I was at the bottom of the stretch and they also stayed on.Update: I tried the Oladance headphones while doing a barbell bench press and they did not stay on very well. The right one fell off while I was getting set for the first rep, then the left one worked its way off during my set. I put them back on and the right on stayed on during the next set, but the left one consistently fell off during every set. So they're not super reliable to say on during a bench press, but I guess that's not very surprising.",

          "These headphones are exactly what Ive been looking for, for a long time! I own and have tried pretty much all traditional types wireless headphones i.e. earbuds, over ear and even traditional on ear headphones. However, I cant wear earbuds, traditional on ear or over the ear headphones for any length of time (say 1 hour max) as they just start to hurt my ears, or make them sweat and are generally uncomfortable to me.However these Oladance headphones fit my needs almost perfectly. I use these for listening to music, TV, audiobooks, podcasts, TED talks etc. Ive also used them for cell phone calls, and Teams Conference meetings. With good to great overall results in all of these used cases.Positive attributes:  - Great sound quality  - Im not a audiofile, but seem very good for music to me  - Long battery life (compared to earbuds)  - Very comfortable  - stay on / in place very well  - Work well with all my devices, incl. my TV  - People I have called report good call quality  - App is straight forward and easy to use  - in general no issues connecting or switching devices  - you can hear your environment and carry on a conversation without taking them off. To me this adds to safety and convenience.Negatives / annoyances:  - some issues with them staying connected e.g. (drop outs) and sometimes just one drops. In these cases it sometimes takes more futzing with them than it should to get them reconnected. I am hoping that future firmware updates will address this issue.  This issue is the only thing keeping them from being a full 5 stars. Further this seems to be increasing so it is something I will contact their customer service about.  - I have not tried them on a plane yet, however given the architecture (no noise canceling active or passive), e.g. letting outside noise in, they may not be ideal for that environment / use.- The touch controls do seem to be overly sensitive I have muted / paused them multiple times unintentionally simply by trying to adjust them on my ear or even trying to adjust my glasses. I have also hung up on a caller once accidentally, so yes they do seem overly sensitive.ConclusionOverall I love these headphones they are the best that Ive owned for general overall use.  I bought these in October 2022 and at Christmas I bought two more pairs one for my wife and one for my daughter, that is how much I feel they are a great product.  They have also told me that they love them.  Too early to tell long-term reliability and durability, but they seem to be built well.I rarely write reviews but felt strongly that this product deserved one.",

          "I am crazy happy with this product!  Back story: I love to walk outside but Id like to be aware of my surroundings. I hate earbuds that stick in the ear. So I tried a few bone conducting or open ear.  I have two favorites that I alternate. I have the Shokz, open run.  They definitely deserve an A+ for sound but a B for comfort.  So I gave the Oladance a try.  Score!Pro:  They are so comfortable you will forget you have them on. I do. I went to brush my teeth one night and realized I still had these things hanging over my ears. Absolutely the most comfortable least intrusive devices Ive ever worn. Sounds very good for phone calls very easy to use. There is an app you can download on your phone which will tutor you on how to except phone calls, hang up phone calls, pause and restart your music or podcasts, change volume, etc.  battery life is quite long. I frequently will put these on first thing in the morning and will take them off at the end of the day.  I do find it a whole lot easier to throw this case  in my purse,  or in my pocket - some thing I will not do with the Shokz for fear of damaging them.  Battery life is extremely long. Easily will last all day. I addressed the downside of the case included and separate battery case Con:  Ive seen a couple people complain about the slim a case that comes with the Oladance. The slim white case which you can see in the picture comes with the buds and its not a battery case.  You have to plug it in to charge the buds in the case.  I thought that was kind of silly so I bought the separate charging case. If you look at my second picture its a chunkier case so I wind up not carrying it. It is handy for travel but only because I can put the earbuds in that and use the charging cable on my phone. In 2020 hindsight I wouldnt spend the extra 50 bucks.  Both the battery case and the regular charging case have a USB-C type charging port. Extremely handy.  Sound is not quite as clear as the Shokz.  If youre an audio file and music is your life, I would go with a Shokz instead or something else these are probably not for you. I want to be able to listen to podcasts, make an answer telephone calls.I did try one other set of open earbuds, the little Sony open ears. Unfortunately either its my ears or its a faulty design they did not stay in. I tried all three of the little loop adjusters, I looked at a YouTube tutorial on how to fit them I looked at Sonys tutorial on how to fit them.  No dice.  They probably had the best sound but you would lose them in five minutes. I see no point in spending $150 on something you cant keep in your ears when there are competitors that are almost as good. Sorry Sony, you lose this category.Edit: I purchased another set of open ear over the ear, Arc, by Cleer.  Pro, great sound, best of the 3.  Con, they shut off if not actively using them.  I can wear the Oladance or the shokz all day, and they don't shut off if I'm not actively using them.  So if a phone call comes in and I'm away from my phone, I'm not going to get the incoming call on my headset. I can live with them for music and podcasts, but they may go back.Edit to add:I just purchased a similar set of earpieces, the Cleer Arc.  I thought I would test them out and see whether they were going to be a Christmas gift for one of my kids, keep them myself, or return them like I did the Sony. I decided I'm keeping them. And they all will dance are still my daily wearable.  I like to be able to put on the earpieces and wear them all day without them shutting off even if I'm not on the phone or not listening to music. Unfortunately the Cleer Arc have a shorter battery life and they turn themselves off in 15 minutes if you are actively using them. The great for walks and the clarity of sound is superior to any of the devices I have tried. Decide based on your use.",

        review:
          "Case:I like the storage case they come with. It looks nice and is about the size of a small glasses case. I like the magnetic seats that the headphones sit in, it makes it easy to put them in the case. The case closes magnetically. To charge the headphones, you put them in the storage case and then hook the case up to power with a USB C cable. It comes with a USB C to USB A cable. I usually charge them via my desktop computer, but you could also plug it into a laptop, wall outlet or power bank, etc. There is a separate case you can buy from Oladance that will charge the headphones while they are in the case, but the headphones do not come with that case.Fit:I am very happy with the fit and comfort of the Oladance headphones. I was worried that they might be uncomfortable -- I have pretty sensitive ears that don't play well with most headphones. I really like that they don't go inside the ear canal and don't put any pressure on the inside curvy parts of my ears. Most in-ear wireless earbud type headphones hurt my ears because I have fairly small ears. These are nice because they don't touch the inside of my ears at all. I also have a cartilage piercing and two lobe piercings, and the headphones don't hit the earrings or irritate the piercings at all, which is very nice (I wear studs for reference, not tested with dangly earrings). When I first put the Oladance on I can tell they are there, but I usually forget I have them on because they are so comfortable. I also did not have a problem wearing them with sunglasses, both the headphones and sunglasses fit on my ears fine. I had a little bit of trouble putting my mask on and taking it off with the headphones on, but with more practice I got better. It is a little cumbersome taking a mask off though.Noise canceling:Since they do not go inside the ear canal, they don't offer much noise canceling, which makes sense. It is like holding a tiny speaker close to the opening of your ear. So if you are planning on using them in a very noisy environment, I would reconsider. In the gym, on a treadmill with other noise around, I can still hear fine if I increase the volume. At home with not much background noise, I listen at fairly low volume.Battery life:The battery life is dependent on volume and use case. The lower the volume the better battery life. Customer service said that if listening at 50% volume or less (and not utilizing the microphone), you can get up to 16hrs battery. Listening at 100% volume, you will get around 10 hrs of battery life. If you use them in call mode (with microphone usage) then that lowers battery life as well. I used them for an all day Zoom class (7-8 hrs) where I was talking off and on with the microphone and then the next day for listening to an audiobook and I got a total of 11.5 hrs of battery life before they died. I chatted with customer service about this and they told me that using them in call mode with the microphone uses more battery, so if I had not been using them to speak in Zoom then I likely would've gotten closer to the 16 hr battery life. Customer service said they can get up to 12 hrs battery life being used in call mode.Activities:I enjoy using the Oladance while I am running errands, shopping and driving. I can have both headphones in and still hear if someone talks to me or if I am at the cashier checking out. It also feels safe walking through parking lots and other environments where you want to be aware of your surroundings. The touch controls work fairly well, I can pause with a tap if someone talks to me. The touch controls are fairly sensitive for play and pause, so sometimes I reach up to touch the headphones to make sure they're still there (since they're so comfy sometimes I want to check they are still there lol) and accidentally play or pause my audio. But I'm overall happy with the touch controls. A workout including treadmill, elliptical, cable machine, some weight lifting, etc was fine, no issues with the headphones. Since the headphones just sit on your ears, I don't think they would be great for gymnastics or other activities where you flip upside down forcefully. I haven't personally tried any exercises where I go upside down quickly or with force, so I can't speak to if they stay on or not, but I don't imagine they would. For a slow, gentle standing forward fold hamstring stretch, they did stay on my ears. I shook my head while I was at the bottom of the stretch and they also stayed on.Update: I tried the Oladance headphones while doing a barbell bench press and they did not stay on very well. The right one fell off while I was getting set for the first rep, then the left one worked its way off during my set. I put them back on and the right on stayed on during the next set, but the left one consistently fell off during every set. So they're not super reliable to say on during a bench press, but I guess that's not very surprising.",

          "A vegetable prep tool helps you chop your vegetables more quickly and with less effort, making soups, salads, and more easier to put together than ever. Before you purchase one for yourself, there are a few things to consider. First, ask yourself what type of vegetable prep tool you want. There are two main types of vegetable prep tools: manual and electric. Manual prep tools require you to do the chopping yourself while electric prep tools do all the work for you. If you have difficulty using a knife or if you’re in the market for a vegetable prep tool simply because you don't like chopping vegetables then a manual or electric prep tool would be a good option for you. Manual prep tools are usually the less expensive of the two and take up less counter space. The next question to ask yourself is what features you’d like the vegetable prep tool to include. Some prep tools come with interchangeable blades that can julienne, chop and slice veggies with ease. Other features can include a stainless steel blade that cuts quickly and precisely or a large tray for catching fruits and veggies after they've been chopped. You’ll also want to ensure that heavy duty blade construction, such as 420 stainless steel is one of the features of the vegetable prep tool you select. Finally, you’ll need to determine your budget. Vegetable prep tools can range in price from around $20 to $100 or more, and the price largely depends on the type and features of the prep tool. An electric model with more features will cost more while a manual prep tool with less features will be less expensive.",

I have super sensitive skin, and so many of the options out there leave my skin itchy and frustrated. My husband did mention they were nice, but we admit they are wrinkly coming out of the dryer if you don’t pull them out right away. They sat in our laundry basket for a week because I was skeptical after they looked more satin/silk than I really wanted. But once we finally put them on the bed, I have been in heaven. I won’t even let our potty training toddler near them until we get a second set in so I know I always have a set available at all times. HEAVEN! A little pricey but better than the $90.00 bamboo cotton sheets I purchased that I wish I could have returned within 30 days. I will tell everyone and shout it to the roof tops so that the business flourishes. They deserve it. Plus this green is beautiful, I just want a million sets of this color alone. GORGEOUS!",

        "I've had the spa for about 4 weeks and I'm loving it.  I've had larger fiberglass hot tubs in the past and I enjoy this model just as much.  So easy to set up.  Mine arrived mid-afternoon and I was sitting in 104 degree water the next evening.  Portability is a plus.  In a few weeks I'm going to drain it, and set up in the basement rec room for winter use.  I like this square model, which provides a little more leg room than a similarly sized round model.  One drawback is the clunky timer function.  You cannot set up on a weekly schedule...you can only set it for one occurrence.  Consequently, I don't use the timer.  I set the spa for 102 and let the thermostat determine when it should run.  My temp varies between 100 to 104, staying at 102 most of the time.",

        "The Perfect Practice Putting Mat is an ideal accessory for golfers of all levels. Constructed with a crystal velvet surface, the mat helps to replicate the natural rolling of a golf ball on real greens. With 9'6\" of length, the mat also features two holes for training and improving your putting accuracy. The auto-return system makes it so you don't have to go around collecting each golf ball after every swing, as it rolls the ball back to you. Markings and lines are printed on the mat to help hone your aim, making this great for right- and left-handed players. Plus, it's been tested and approved by former World #1 PGA Tour Pro Dustin Johnson. The Perfect Practice Putting Mat is perfect for any golfer who wants to level up their game at home or on-the-go - making it a great gift idea too!",

        "After 4 weeks of use, 1. Developed with price in mind. It is not a $3,000 simulated turf putting green and don’t expect it to be. 2. All practice drills and tools each have a specific purpose this is no different it is one piece of the puzzle. Perfect Practice will definitely allow you to refine your putting stoke and fundamentals to help you become an overall better putter but it is one piece. 3. It is manufactured and packaged with price a key consideration. Good to high quality; but making it optimal for shipping pricing has caused them to fold or roll the surface more than I believe they wanted to and I can imagine the product team discussion on this point. 4. Getting the surface to lay flat. Depending on what you desire it will be a challenge. I laid things out as you see in my photo. It had more bumps than I would prefer. I gave it a couple of days. Not much change. I then took a 8’ 1x12 and placed it on 1/2 with two cinder blocks on top for three days. Only minimal improvement - sill more bumps and higher than I preferred. I used a steam iron “carefully” without much improvement. I then took a staple gun (this is where it will always be and no one will be moving it) and I stapled it at the bump points on the edges. I’m a golfer and I don’t care about the hardwood floor…and it’s a game room. This improved things considerably but I still had humps or slight bumps that influenced the ball roll enough that I finally we to the nuclear option. 4” wide double sided rug tape. I pulled out the staples and then very carefully found the bumps and applied the tape to those sections, starting at the cup end and working my way back down the runway until complete. Even then there remained some rises along the piping on the edge that I still stapled down. At this point I was all in anyway. Now I have a Perfect Practice setup like the factory did it. And I can use the full 15 feet with out the surface having any influence on the ball. Actually I probably fixed it too good. It’s a hardwood flood and I did not consider the very subtle crown the boards have. On the long putts which have higher speed if I do not get the putt rolling smoothly it can bounce on occasion. But that is good visual feedback and I know immediately what I did.Finally, my rating is high. Just because I’m a golf nut it was not fair to be hard on these folks with my goal of perfection. This is why I titled this “do not let Perfect be the enemy of Good” You do not have to do all that I have to have a very good inexpensive putting practice tool that will make you much improved at putting. And if you like to be perfect you now know what it will take….most likely. Oh, and make sure it is a space your wife will let you get away with doing what I have done. I’m a lucky man",

      review:
        "Hallelujah! Critical Mother-in-law APPROVED! I bought this electric tea kettle for my MIL to use when visiting, because during her last visit, I caught her microwaving water in a mug for FOUR MINUTES to make TEA! The mug cracked, of course. Her explanation for going overboard: MY water doesn’t boil as hot as HER water. Yes, she’s one of THOSE mother-in-laws. If that lady doesn’t get her ritual morning tea and toast, it could be catastrophic for EVERYONE. I haven’t been able to solve the mystery of why the same brands of butter, bread, and tea are inferior at my house (as opposed to hers), but surely I can get this lady some hot water for her tea without her or any unsuspecting soul getting blasted in the face by an exploding cup of water, when the microwave door is opened (the toaster is a story for a later date). She doesn’t like stove kettles and it’s just as well, because I have a glass stovetop built into my kitchen island. There’d be a fire when something got set on the hot burner that blends in with the countertop. I searched Amazon & thought about an electric kettle that was clear(so she could SEE the water was indeed boiling), but we already established that “boiling” doesn’t mean anything to her- not to mention the spout looked like it could dribble. I finally decided on this kettle. It has various temperature setting buttons ranging from 180 degrees to 212. It even has recommended uses labeled under the according temp (180 for green tea and white tea, 195 for Oolong and airpress coffee, 200 for black tea or French press, 205 for herbal tea or pour overs, or the BIG GUN 212 for BOIL). Plus it has a “keep warm” setting. I thought MAYBE since it SAID only 200 degrees needed for her black tea...that MAYBE pushing that highest button “BOIL” might give her some satisfaction. Be warned, that if this is for a gift for someone in your own household, you will need to specify to “hide contents” at the gift option in checkout, because it came in its product packaging. It was packaged very well, very straightforward simple directions on one sheet of paper and in English, easy set up, very attractive design, easy to operate. Its all very well thought out. It’s not complicated at all. Even my MIL had the patience to work it, and believe me, she’d find any excuse NOT to use it. She never griped once. It’s a skinny spout that pours away from the side of the pot. Absolutely no dribbling, splashing, or lid coming off while pouring. The lid kind of snaps into place. It doesn’t fall off at all but isn’t difficult to purposefully TAKE off. It doesn’t have a rubber seal or anything so you can’t turn this thing upside-down, completely side-ways, or shake it wildly. I safely walked into living room to pour a “warm up” for someone’s tea, and since the spout is a goose neck that starts out low but curves up almost to level of lid, and the max water fill line inside is a safe distance away from the top, there’s not much worry about splashing out if held upright while walking across kitchen or whatever. I can easily pour this one-handed. It’s a very gentle, directed, and SAFE pour without taking forever to fill your cup. It’s so directed and precise that you could fill a soda bottle without spilling a drop. Outside of pot does get hot so must use handle. But it’s lightweight and fits in the hand well. There’s a “thumbprint grip” on handle, to help control. Simple to set back on top of the base- without having to look to see if anything is lined up, and no flat base for it to slip off of...you can tell when it’s on because the piece that sticks up from the base is a couple inches in diameter and sticks up about an inch to fit inside the corresponding indentation on bottom of kettle. When pot is replaced you can just let it sit and it will eventually turn off, or you can push “keep warm” (holds temp for 30 mins)or choose a different temp, or turn off. The pot stays hot for a while so you could walk away for a while and it still wouldn’t take any time at all to heat up to temp again even if you don’t don’t press keep warm setting. The next time the unit is turned on, it will automatically be at that last used setting. If the pot is turned off, when u lift up the kettle to fill with water and set it back down again, it automatically wakes up. The last used temp button will glow, and all you need to do is push “power.” The temp and power buttons are BOTH lit while in process of heating water. It’ll heat up and beep when done. It is a beep that won’t wake up the whole house. It’s easy to tune out (not always a good thing) so keep an ear out for the beep. The power light will turn off and the temp button will stay lit after it has beeped. So if you miss the beep, you can easily tell. It won’t keep boiling if you miss it. The max fill line inside is actually a metal tab that sticks out so you can easily see it. It’s a 4 cup pot but that’s using the smaller mugs. It’ll fill 2 big latte cups or 3 of my midsize mugs. You could use to add to Ramen noodle cups, etc. Any part of the kettle that touches the water is stainless steel. The only non-metal parts I see is on very top knob on outside of lid, grip part of handle, and part of the base (like the non-conductive handles on some stove pots). Despite my being a coffee drinker, I actually love this pot and have chosen tea over coffee many times now. I ended up trying it out on a blooming flower tea to give it a test run before MIL came. It worked great because it got hot enough to open the flower and the spout is small enough that I can add more water without destroying the flower. It’s easy to keep clean. Any fingerprints wipe easily off. I was originally planning on keeping it in a cupboard or in the box between MIL visits, but I love to use it and it looks very sharp on my countertop. I’ll be giving these as gifts this Christmas. The company seems to have good customer service, and part of the proceeds go to Wounded Warrior Project and pediatric healthcare in Uganda. My ONLY disappointment is that it’s not made in USA. That surprised me. It’s a veteran-inspired company so I expected it to be made in USA.",

Not to be "braggadocious", but I speak from a LOT of experience ...as a dad whose family (mom, dad, sister, and I) went through "dermatological hell", I\'ve become more experienced with skin and acne (+ eczema, and more serious skin malady) products than anyone should have to! ...I often joke, that if "someone looks at us the wrong way, our skin reacts badly, and breaks out"Lately, I\'ve been trying many brands of acne patches with my special needs (young adult) daughter ... She gets mostly surface acne, some hormonal acne, and a few cystic "beauties" (ugh) ... She\'s such a sweet, pretty "kid", who DESERVES to have equally pretty skin ... but our family skin history is a fight, and it\'s hard to keep her from touching her face. She can\'t do self care for her skin ... so I do it ...Some of brands of these patches work very well at drawing out impurities, ie all the "junk", but some don\'t. Unfortunately, the brands with quantities of 120, 180, etc often seem less effective, especially the small 8mm size. They\'re useless, while the larger sizes are sometimes OK, but inconsistently draw out the "junk" ... Generally though, the "bargain" ones, have not proven to be an actual bargain."Hero" patches have been very good, but $12 (approx) for 36 patches is a bit high, in my humble opinion.After reading some reviews, and watching a video or two, I\'m now using THIS brand, "Dots for Spots" ($14 for 60 medium size). I\'ve been pleases to see that they\'re consistently drawing out all the "yuck" out of the blemish, so the skin can then heal ... Yes, a big one, like a cystic one is RED afterward, but at least it\'s OUT, and FLAT, and ready to heal.THESE patches (Dots for Spots) are a bit difficult to peel off (a CLEAN tweezer helps), and they should be firmly "sealed" against the surrounding skin, but if applied correctly, THEY WORK!I wish these products did something even more important, PREVENTED the acne ... THAT is more the territory of Retin-A type products (prescription, or OTC). These are often CHALLENGING to use, as they can cause a LOT of redness and photosensitivity, REQUIRING sunblock (that wont clog pores) EVERY time we go outside! ...If you have a similar goal (prevention of acne), with a similar safety concern, read about BAKUCHIOL (yes, it sounds like it\'d be a Pokemon character, haha). It looks to be a Retin-A alternative that\'s MUCH safer ...Good luck to all ... Peace :-)',

      review:
        'NOTE: This review is on my wife\'s account (we just use hers). Not to be "braggadocious", but I speak from a LOT of experience ...as a dad whose family (mom, dad, sister, and I) went through "dermatological hell", I\'ve become more experienced with skin and acne (+ eczema, and more serious skin malady) products than anyone should have to! ...I often joke, that if "someone looks at us the wrong way, our skin reacts badly, and breaks out"Lately, I\'ve been trying many brands of acne patches with my special needs (young adult) daughter ... She gets mostly surface acne, some hormonal acne, and a few cystic "beauties" (ugh) ... She\'s such a sweet, pretty "kid", who DESERVES to have equally pretty skin ... but our family skin history is a fight, and it\'s hard to keep her from touching her face. She can\'t do self care for her skin ... so I do it ...Some of brands of these patches work very well at drawing out impurities, ie all the "junk", but some don\'t. Unfortunately, the brands with quantities of 120, 180, etc often seem less effective, especially the small 8mm size. They\'re useless, while the larger sizes are sometimes OK, but inconsistently draw out the "junk" ... Generally though, the "bargain" ones, have not proven to be an actual bargain."Hero" patches have been very good, but $12 (approx) for 36 patches is a bit high, in my humble opinion.After reading some reviews, and watching a video or two, I\'m now using THIS brand, "Dots for Spots" ($14 for 60 medium size). I\'ve been pleases to see that they\'re consistently drawing out all the "yuck" out of the blemish, so the skin can then heal ... Yes, a big one, like a cystic one is RED afterward, but at least it\'s OUT, and FLAT, and ready to heal.THESE patches (Dots for Spots) are a bit difficult to peel off (a CLEAN tweezer helps), and they should be firmly "sealed" against the surrounding skin, but if applied correctly, THEY WORK!I wish these products did something even more important, PREVENTED the acne ... THAT is more the territory of Retin-A type products (prescription, or OTC). These are often CHALLENGING to use, as they can cause a LOT of redness and photosensitivity, REQUIRING sunblock (that wont clog pores) EVERY time we go outside! ...If you have a similar goal (prevention of acne), with a similar safety concern, read about BAKUCHIOL (yes, it sounds like it\'d be a Pokemon character, haha). It looks to be a Retin-A alternative that\'s MUCH safer ...Good luck to all ... Peace :-)',

      review:
        "I've got a dog that sheds. I also had an office chair made from a black cloth automotive seat that showed everything. Normal lint rollers would not clean it....neither would a vacuum. So I thought I would try this out. I will give this thing credit, it worked a lot better than lint rollers did. Here are some pros and cons of this device:Pros:- Easy to use: This is pretty easy to use. You run it back and forth in quick motions to remove lint and hair. Doing this a few times removed a good portion of the hair and lint on that chair. When I first started using it, I just pulled it in a single direction, not thinking you're supposed to do it back and forth. Once I did the back and forth, it worked really well. Cleaning is super easy. Just open up the back, and empty out the tray.- Effective: This worked great compared to traditional lint rollers or using a vacuum. It was very effective in the open, flat areas of the chair, not so much in the seams, arms joints, or where the back and seat merge. Was it perfect? No, but it worked better than anything I've tried so far.- Quality: This really seems like it will hold up pretty well. I put it through it's paces pretty quick after opening, putting a lot of force behind it, doing long periods of use, and some normal drop testing. It held up pretty good. The lint compartment can open up easily when dropped or too much pressure applied, but that is not a deal breaker for me.Cons:- Cleaning in Tight Spots: This is where this really fell short. I have some areas that are hard to get to, such as the seat/back merge point and the seams. This is where this just does not work. You still need something to get into the cracks and into tight spots.- Price: I purchased mine when it was on sale, so I think I got a pretty good deal. At full price, this might be a deal breaker when you can purchase sticky lint rollers for much less. It really comes down to what you are using it for, how often, and how open of areas you need to clean. This works great in open areas, and it works great on furniture, but I have my doubts on clothes, which is what a lot of people use traditional rollers on.- Cleaning the Pads: I found this to be a little hard to do. Once you use it, most of the lint and hair is trapped in the tray, which you just dump out into a trash can. But the little pads on the actual lint remover traps some in it. This was a bit harder to clean. I could get most of it out, but it took some effort to really get the pads cleaned.- Lint Tray Door: The lint tray door was easy to pop open, both during use and if you drop it. If I was using it on a surface facing up, I could grip it in such a way that it would not open. But as soon as I changed to a side facing surface, I had to really pay attention to how I held it. It would pop open if I put too much pressure on it, or I would accidentally hit the release.In summary, this is a great alternative to cleaning furniture, especially on longer, more open surfaces. This is where I'd recommend getting this product. It is not perfect, but for me it worked very good on something that I struggled to get clean with traditional lint rollers or vacuums. This is not something that I would use on clothes or in tight spaces.",

        "OK, let's clear up a few things: 1) I am a real buyer, was not given this pillow, was not paid to review this pillow.  There's no way I'm doing any of that.2)  I want everyone to know exactly what I'm giving an opinion on.  This 'Beckham Hotel' pillow is the very same as others called 'Sleep Restoration Super Plush Gel-Fiber Filled Pillows'. That's what the package the two pillows (costing $35 total)  came in reads, and there's a small bar-coded sticker with tiny writing indicating the Beckham Hotel re-branding.3)  There's NO smell.  There's NO mildew.  They arrived factory clean and shipped in a nice, zipped plastic container bag.4)  They arrive dead flat.  When you remove them, they start to fluff up. I'd say after an hour or so they are ready to use.  Fluff them a bit, and you can sleep on them right away.  It's not necessary to put them in a dryer and in fact it could be detrimental.  Not sure.5)  I waited a month to write this because I wanted to be sure I liked the pillows.  I do!6)  I had some doubts at first because I thought they'd be too soft, but after a couple of nights I would now describe them as soft, yet firm enough to support my head and neck correctly.  I start out sleeping on my side and of course, at some point end up on my back, and then often back on my side.7)  They're heavy enough to no move around, but not heavy like a (solid) memory foam pillow is.  They stay put in other words.8)  I purchased the queen sized ones.  Now, it was sort of interesting to me that these are 20 inches wide, and yet a queen size pillowcase is also 20 inches wide.  Yet, a pillow is quite high and a pillowcase is of course - flat.  This means it requires some effort to squeeze the pillow into the pillowcase.  BUT, perhaps this makes the pillow seem a bit firmer than my initial impression of it was in paragraph #6.  At any rate, it works and these have worked out well for me.9)  I woke up in a hotel about 4 years ago with neck pain and had it ever since.  All sorts of chiropractic efforts, daily neck stretches, painkillers, etc. just didn't seem to get rid of it.  I ditched my Tempur-Pedic s-shaped solid memory foam pillow and tried several other pillows I got locally.  They all went back.  I got these pillows, continued on the daily neck stretches and now I'm feeling fine with no more neck pain.  I noticed about a week ago I was waking up with no more neck pain.  That's a relief.That's about all I can tell you Amazon shoppers.  Buying a pillow is a wilderness of choice.  I spent a LOT of hours on here looking.  And of course pillows, and the comfort of them, is very personal and subjective.  I can only say, for me, these worked out.  If they don't for you, I assume you can return them, possibly with some shipping cost.  I don't know.  I'm not a regular Amazon customer and not a Prime member.Best of luck finding yours!-MSW",
